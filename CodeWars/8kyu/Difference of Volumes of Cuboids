// In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. 
// Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. 
// You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

// For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), 
// the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

// Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.




function findDifference(a, b) {
  
  let aVolume = a[0] * a[1] * a[2];
  let bVolume = b[0] * b[1] * b[2];
  
  
  if (aVolume > bVolume) {
    let diff1 = aVolume-bVolume;
    return diff1;
  }
  else {
    let diff2 = bVolume - aVolume;
    return diff2;
  }  
}
